## Features

SCATS offers a range of features designed to enhance your programming experience:

- **Immutable Collections**: Work with collections that cannot be modified after creation, ensuring data integrity.
- **Monads**: Utilize monadic structures to handle side effects and asynchronous programming.
- **Pattern Matching**: Simplify conditional logic with powerful pattern matching capabilities.
- **Option and Either Types**: Manage optional values and error handling in a clean and expressive way.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Improve performance by delaying computation until necessary.
- **Type Classes**: Implement polymorphism and code reuse through type classes.

## Installation

To install SCATS, use npm or yarn. Run one of the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm install scats
```

or

```bash
yarn add scats
```

Once installed, you can import SCATS in your TypeScript files:

```typescript
import { ... } from 'scats';
```

## Usage

SCATS is designed to be straightforward and intuitive. You can start using it right away with minimal setup. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

```typescript
import { List } from 'scats';

const myList = List.of(1, 2, 3);
const doubled = myList.map(x => x * 2);

console.log(doubled.toArray()); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

For more detailed examples and use cases, check out the [Examples](#examples) section.

## Core Concepts

### Immutable Collections

Immutable collections are a core feature of SCATS. They allow you to create data structures that do not change after they are created. This helps prevent bugs related to unintended side effects.

#### Example:

```typescript
import { List } from 'scats';

const originalList = List.of(1, 2, 3);
const newList = originalList.append(4);

console.log(originalList.toArray()); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
console.log(newList.toArray()); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Monads

Monads are a design pattern that helps manage side effects and asynchronous programming. SCATS provides several monadic types, including `Option`, `Either`, and `Try`.

#### Example:

```typescript
import { Option } from 'scats';

const maybeValue = Option.of(null);
const result = maybeValue.map(value => value * 2).getOrElse(0);

console.log(result); // Output: 0
```

### Pattern Matching

Pattern matching allows you to destructure data types and perform actions based on their shape. This can simplify complex conditional logic.

#### Example:

```typescript
import { match } from 'scats';

const value = { type: 'success', data: 'Hello, World!' };

match(value)
  .with({ type: 'success', data: (data) => console.log(data) })
  .otherwise(() => console.log('Error'));
```

### Option and Either Types

`Option` and `Either` types help manage optional values and errors in a functional way. They provide a clean alternative to null checks and exceptions.

#### Example:

```typescript
import { Either } from 'scats';

const divide = (a: number, b: number): Either<string, number> => {
  if (b === 0) {
    return Either.left('Division by zero');
  }
  return Either.right(a / b);
};

const result = divide(10, 0);

result
  .map(value => console.log(value))
  .mapLeft(error => console.error(error));
```

### Lazy Evaluation

Lazy evaluation allows you to defer computation until the result is needed. This can improve performance, especially with large data sets.

#### Example:

```typescript
import { LazyList } from 'scats';

const lazyList = LazyList.from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
const filtered = lazyList.filter(x => x % 2 === 0);

console.log(filtered.toArray()); // Output: [2, 4]
```

### Type Classes

Type classes enable polymorphism and code reuse. They allow you to define generic behavior that can be implemented for different types.

#### Example:

```typescript
import { typeClass } from 'scats';

const show = typeClass({
  String: {
    show: (value: string) => `"${value}"`,
  },
  Number: {
    show: (value: number) => value.toString(),
  },
});

console.log(show.String.show('Hello')); // Output: "Hello"
console.log(show.Number.show(42)); // Output: 42
```
